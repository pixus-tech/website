## üöÄ Quick start

1. **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

   ```shell
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. **Create a Gatsby site from pixus.**

   ```sh
   gatsby new histaff https://github.com/histaff/website-static/
   ```

3. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

   Next, move into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up:

   ```sh
   cd histaff/
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `histaff` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you‚Äôve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
